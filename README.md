# UShell: Command Line Interpreter for Unity

UShell is a tool that allows developers to interact with unity and the game at runtime by sending command lines to a shell.

It provides the user with a terminal to interact with the shell by typing command lines and see logs on the screen.

The user can easily create new commands by using the Convar and Cmd attributes to fields/properties/methods or create more sophisticated commands by implementing the ICommand interface.
Consoles can also be implemented and offer new ways for the user to interact with the shell.
